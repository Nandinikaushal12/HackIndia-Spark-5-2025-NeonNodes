# Cross-Chain Profit Pilot: AI-Powered Arbitrage Bot

A hackathon project that demonstrates an AI-powered cross-chain arbitrage bot for cryptocurrency trading. This project identifies price discrepancies across different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on multiple blockchains and simulates the execution of profitable trades.

## Features

1. **Data Aggregation**: Simulates real-time price data from multiple DEXs across different blockchains
2. **AI Analysis**: Visual representation of AI-driven insights on arbitrage opportunities
3. **Trade Execution**: Mock trade execution flow that demonstrates the arbitrage process
4. **Performance Tracking**: Visualization of trade history and profit metrics
5. **Cross-Chain Bridging**: Simulation of cross-chain asset transfers

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for performance metrics
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom dark theme optimized for trading interfaces

## Project Structure

- `/src/components` - UI components for the dashboard
- `/src/hooks` - Custom React hooks, including the arbitrage data simulation
- `/src/lib` - Utility functions and mock data generation
- `/src/types` - TypeScript interfaces for arbitrage data
- `/src/pages` - Main application pages

## How It Works (MVP Demo)

This project is a functional MVP that demonstrates how an AI-powered arbitrage bot would work:

1. **Price Discovery**: The system monitors token prices across different exchanges and blockchains
2. **Opportunity Identification**: It identifies price differences that exceed transaction costs
3. **Risk Assessment**: The AI component analyzes risks such as slippage and liquidity shifts
4. **Trade Execution**: When profitable opportunities are found, trades can be executed
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Dashboard tracks all activities and calculates profitability

## For a Production System

To turn this MVP into a production-ready system, you would need to:

1. Integrate with real DEX APIs or blockchain nodes for live price data
2. Implement actual blockchain wallets and smart contracts for trade execution
3. Train and deploy real machine learning models for risk assessment
4. Set up secure private key management and transaction signing
5. Add robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. Implement comprehensive logging and alerting systems

## Note

This is a hackathon demonstration project and not financial advice. Real arbitrage trading involves significant risks and technical challenges.
